# Mbed TLS CI

Out of source test infrastructure information for Mbed TLS.

When raising a PR in [mbedtls](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls) a range of tests will be run automatically. This repository contains all the information required to reproduce these tests. This can be particularly useful for reproducing failures on a PR.

The docker files in `resources/docker_files` are the ones used by the CI. For more information see the corresponding readme: `resources/docker_files/README.md`.
